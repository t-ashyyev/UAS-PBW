					<h1>Some stories about coffee</h1>
					
					<p>In the United States, about 15% of the coffee drunk annually is instant coffee. In the UK, where instant coffee is known as soluble coffee, Nestle controls over 50 percent of the instant coffee market, and has since the early 1990s. In Germany, widely known for its preference for quality coffee, people drink over 14,000 tons of instant coffee annually. Even in Italy, home of espresso, sales of instant coffee are on the rise. What is the appeal of instant coffee?

						If you’re part of the coffee elite, it’s sometimes hard to remember that not too long ago, instant coffee was considered to be state-of-the-art in coffee making. In the 1950s and the 1960s, some 43 percent of all the coffee drunk in the United States was made by stirring instant coffee into a cup of boiled water. Instant coffee has its advantages, though many coffee purists turn their noses up at it.
						Instant coffee is easy. You don’t need any equipment other than a cup, a spoon and a source of hot water. While the quality of the finished cup of coffee depends on the starting quality of the coffee, if you start with decent instant coffee, it’s really hard to go wrong with instant coffee. Just add boiling water and stir. </p>

						View of Mocha, Yemen during the second half of the 17th century
						The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea. One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast. Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia. According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401. Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in the Zeila region. Coffee was first exported from Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila in modern-day Somaliland, which was procured from Harar and the Abyssinian interior. According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839–1854), Mocha historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera-based merchants before the coffee trade of Mocha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. Thereafter, much of the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.</p>
